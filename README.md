Notes of Destiny is a high-fantasy HD-2D RPG focusing uniquely on a musical world. You play as a Violin who has just arrived at the Castle of Harmony in Melodonia—the Kingdom of Music—and must attempt to liberate Melodonia from the clutches of the War Kingdom by retaking control of the Anchors: the lodes that generate Melodonia's powers. 

The game combines rhythm elements with a regular RPG, where you activate your abilities by playing a short rhythm minigame.

Developed with Unreal Engine 5 by Flow State Interactive Inc.
